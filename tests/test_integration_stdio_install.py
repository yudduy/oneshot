"""Integration test for stdio server installation and agent rebuild.

This test reproduces the full bug scenario:
1. Local installer creates StdioServerSpec with empty env dict
2. Config conversion to FastMCP format
3. Agent rebuild with FastMCP validation

Bug reproduction: User runs "install vercel mcp", system installs @cloudflare/playwright-mcp
locally, creates StdioServerSpec with env={}, conversion fails with Pydantic validation error.

Fixed in:
- /Users/duy/Documents/build/DeepMCPAgent/src/oneshotmcp/config.py (env field handling)
- /Users/duy/Documents/build/DeepMCPAgent/src/oneshotmcp/orchestrator.py (ranking filter)
